# CitiBike Electric Bike and Ridership Revenue Project

This was my final project for UC Berkeley's Statistics for Data Science course. In this project, my team delved into the rich Citibike dataset using R to explore station ridership levels. Our primary focus lies in understanding the influence of electric bikes on revenue generation, examining the varying availability of e-bikes across different stations and their potential impact.

Our study explores the impact of electric bikes on Citi Bike's revenue, given the recent surge in  popularity, constituting 20% of the fleet and accounting for half of all rides. Despite this growth, the fleet composition and revenue relationship remains unclear. Understanding this dynamic is crucial as Citi Bike relies solely on revenue from sponsorship and ridership. Using publicly-available ride data, we empirically investigate how the proportion of rides initiated from stations with electric bikes correlates with average revenue per ride, employing regression models for station-level analysis.
